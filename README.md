Ollama Native macOS Client
Introduction
This project is an open-source initiative to build a beautiful and intuitive native macOS application that serves as a graphical user interface (GUI) for Ollama. It aims to provide a seamless and powerful way for macOS users to interact with local Large Language Models (LLMs), combining a rich feature set with a polished, native user experience.

The application is designed for users who value data privacy, offline capabilities, and a high degree of customization when experimenting with local AI.

Core Features
Our vision extends beyond a simple chat interface. We are building a comprehensive tool for local AI exploration with three core pillars:

ðŸš€ Core Chat Interface: A responsive and intuitive chat window to interact with your local LLMs. It supports real-time streaming of responses for a fluid conversational experience.

ðŸ“¦ Model Management:

Model Changer: Easily switch between all your locally installed Ollama models.

Model Discovery: Browse, download, and manage models from the official Ollama library directly within the app.

ðŸ¤– Interactive 2D Avatar: (Under Development)

An animated 2D avatar that brings conversations to life.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): The avatar will voice the LLM's responses using native macOS TTS capabilities.

Expressive Animations: Features idle animations, facial expressions based on context, and simplified lip synchronization for a more engaging interaction.

Technology Stack
This application is being built with a focus on native performance, deep OS integration, and a modern development approach.

UI Framework: SwiftUI

Language: Swift

Architecture: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)

Animation: SpriteKit for 2D avatar animations.

Audio: AVFoundation for Text-to-Speech.
